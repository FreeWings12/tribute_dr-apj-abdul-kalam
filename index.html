                <li><strong>Dr. Kalam</strong> sold newspapers to supplement his family's income at an early age
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dr. Kalam </strong> had average grades in his school years but was described as a bright
                    and
                    hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn.</li>
                <li><strong>1954 </strong> - graduated from Saint Joseph's College in physics</li>
                <li><strong>1955 </strong> - moved to Madras to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of
                    Technology.</li>
                <li><strong>1960 </strong> - After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology, Dr. Kalam
                    joined
                    the
                    Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by
                    Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the
                    Defence
                    Research & Development Service (DRDS).</li>
                <li><strong>1969 </strong> - Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
                    where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
                    successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first
                    started
                    work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.</li>
                <li><strong>1969 </strong> - Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to
                    include more engineers.</li>
                <li><strong>1963-1964 </strong> - he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia;
                    Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility</li>
                <li><strong>1970-1990</strong> - Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle
                    (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.</li>
                <li><strong>Dr. Kalam </strong> was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear
                    test
                    Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its
                    development.</li>
                <li><strong>1970s </strong> - Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant,
                    which
                    sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.
                    Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds
                    for
                    these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.</li>
                <li><strong>Dr. Kalam </strong> played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal
                    the true nature of these classified aerospace projects. His research and educational leadership
                    brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate
                    an
                    advanced missile programme under his directorship</li>
                <li><strong>Dr. Kalam </strong> and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the
                    Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a
                    proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles
                    one
                    after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating
                    â‚¹
                    3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and
                    appointed Kalam as the chief executive.</li>
                <li><strong>Dr. Kalam </strong> played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission
                    including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical
                    surface-to-surface
                    missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time
                    overruns.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1992-1999 </strong> - Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister
                    and
                    Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation</li>
                <li><strong>The Pokhran-II</strong> nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he
                    played
                    an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator,
                    along
                    with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.</li>
                <li><strong>1998</strong> along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary
                    stent,
                    named the "Kalam-Raju Stent". the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural
                    areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet"</li>
                <li><strong>2002-2007 </strong> Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R.

                    Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore; chancellor of the Indian
                    Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering
                    at
                    Anna University; and an adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India.
                    He
                    taught information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology,

                    Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs,
                    he
                    experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around
                    6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby
                    Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of
                    life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden
                    cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST. His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were
                    reportedly: <em> "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</em></li>

                <p> <em>"I have identified five areas where India has a core competence for integrated action:
                        (1)
                        agriculture and food processing; (2) education and healthcare; (3) information and
                        communication technology; (4) infrastructure, reliable and quality electric power,
                        surface
                        transport and infrastructure for all parts of the country; and (5) self-reliance in
                        critical
                        technologies. These five areas are closely inter-related and if advanced in a
                        coordinated
                        way, will lead to food, economic and national security."</em></p>
